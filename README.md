# Lemin
Ant Farm Algorithm Project

## How To Run
```
make re  
usage: ./lem-in < [map]
```
you can find maps in the map folder

## Program Description
* The goal of this project is to find the quickest way to get n ants across the farm.
* Quickest way means the solution with the least number of lines, respecting the output format requested below.
* Obviously, there are some basic constraints. To be the first to arrive, ants will need to take the shortest path (and that isnâ€™t necessarily the simplest). They will also need to avoid traffic jams as well as walking all over their fellow ants.
* At the beginning of the game, all the ants are in the room ##start. The goal is to bring them to the room ##end with as few turns as possible. Each room can only contain one ant at a time. (except at ##start and ##end which can contain as many ants as necessary.)
* We consider that all the ants are in the room ##start at the beginning of the game.
* At each turn you will only display the ants that moved.
* At each turn you can move each ant only once and through a tube (the room at the receiving end must be empty).
* You must to display your results on the standard output in the following format:
```
number_of_ants
the_rooms
the_links

Lx-y Lz-w Lr-o ...
```

## Map Format
* Your program will receive the data describing the ant farm from the standard output in the following format:
```
number_of_ants
the_rooms
the_links
```
* The ant farm is defined by the following links:
```
10                    => first digit will determin ant amount
##start
1 23 3                => this will be the starting node ants come out from
2 16 7                => room define: name coor_x coor_y (coor used for visuals)
#comment              => comments can be written anywhere      
3 16 3
4 16 5
5 9 3
6 1 5
7 4 8
##end
0 9 5                 => ants final destination
0-4                   => links define: name1-name2
0-6
1-3
4-3
5-2
3-5
#another comment
4-2
2-1
7-6
7-2
7-4
6-5
#another comment
```
- Which corresponds to the following representation:
```
           _______________
          /               \ 
  ______[5]----[3]----[1] |
 /              |    /    |
[6]-----[0]----[4]  /     |
 \    _________/|  /      |
  \ /          [2]/_______/
  [7]__________/
```

## My Solution
### Parsing
* Since rooms are defined by (name, x, y) coordinates only need to be used for a visualizer which I didn't use so I ignored them.
* I stored the names inside a queue (you can find my own personal queue in libft) since the amount of rooms is indefinite.
* That allows me to store an indefinite numbers of room.
* Since the names of the rooms are random and are used to see which points are linked I used a **dictionary** (dict in libft) to access them in O(1) time and not use strcmp which would be O(n) very slow in case there was 10,000 nodes.
* I used **adjacency lists** for graph representation.
### Solving
* Me and my teammate thought about many different ways to solve this problem, our initial attempt was just a shortest path algorithm which would work for finding only one path and delete the already found path and run the algorithm again for n paths found.
* However we found out about max flow algorithms and ended up implementing **Edmund Karps** max flow algorithm.
* We stored all the paths inside a queue.
### Displaying
* Reminder: Display format is L(ant_number)-(goes to room_name)
* This was the hardest part of the problem but my solution involved using a list of **decks**, I changed from queue to deck because working on a queue didnt allow me to have the flexibility I needed to print this info.
* Taking the example above as consideration my list of decks would be:
  * 1-2-4-0
  * 1-3-5-6-0  
* Each node of the deck has:
  * A boolean that represents if the current node has an ant, 
  * An int that represented the room number of the path,
  * The next and previous nodes.
* We also had to figure out a small algorithm to know how many ants to send in each path.
* Finally, I printed everything out by going right to left on the deck, and once I reached the start node I would send an ant if it was necessary according to the amount of ants left and our small algorithm.
