# Lemin
Ant algorithm project
Must be able to handle up to 10000 nodes

## How To Run
```
make re  
usage: ./lem-in < [map]
```
you can find maps in the map folder

## Program Description

- The goal of this project is to find the quickest way to get n ants across the farm.
- Quickest way means the solution with the least number of lines, respecting the output format requested below.
- Obviously, there are some basic constraints. To be the first to arrive, ants will need to take the shortest path (and that isnâ€™t necessarily the simplest). They will also need to avoid traffic jams as well as walking all over their fellow ants.
- At the beginning of the game, all the ants are in the room ##start. The goal is to bring them to the room ##end with as few turns as possible. Each room can only contain one ant at a time. (except at ##start and ##end which can contain as many ants as necessary.)
- We consider that all the ants are in the room ##start at the beginning of the game.
- At each turn you will only display the ants that moved.
- At each turn you can move each ant only once and through a tube (the room at the receiving end must be empty).
- You must to display your results on the standard output in the following format:
```
number_of_ants
the_rooms
the_links

Lx-y Lz-w Lr-o ...
```

## Map Format
- Your program will receive the data describing the ant farm from the standard output in the following format:
```
number_of_ants
the_rooms
the_links
```
- The ant farm is defined by the following links:
```
##start
1 23 3
2 16 7
#comment

4 16 5

- Which corresponds to the following representation:
```
           _______________
          /               \ 
  ______[5]----[3]----[1] |

[6]-----[0]----[4]  /     |
 \    _________/|  /      |
  \ /          [2]/_______/
  [7]__________/
```
